- Independent user management and data isolation

### 2. Customizable Branding
```json
{
  "school": {
    "name": "Your School Name",
    "primaryColor": "#f89e24",
    "logo": "/logos/your-school-logo.png"
  }
}
```

### 3. Easy Setup Process
```bash
# Interactive setup for new schools
pnpm run setup-school

# Automated Firebase project configuration
# Deployment script generation
# Environment file creation
```

### 4. Flexible Deployment
```bash
# Deploy specific school
./scripts/deploy.sh school1

# Deploy all schools
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Deploy just Firestore rules
./scripts/deploy-rules.sh
```

### 5. Development Environment
```bash
# Development server for specific school
pnpm run dev:school1

# Build for specific school  
pnpm run build:school1
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Configuration Loading
- Static imports for build-time optimization
- Environment variable override system
- Fallback to default configuration
- Template variable replacement

### Firebase Integration
- Dynamic project initialization
- School-specific App Check configuration
- Backward compatible exports
- Environment-based configuration

### Build System
- Vite environment variable support
- School-specific build commands
- Asset optimization per school
- Development server customization

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Setting Up a New School

1. **Run Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run setup-school
   ```

2. **Configure Firebase Project**:
   - Create Firebase project
   - Enable required services
   - Update configuration file with credentials

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-school-newschool.sh
   ```

### Customizing School Branding

```json
{
  "school": {
    "name": "Montessori School Berlin",
    "primaryColor": "#4CAF50",
    "logo": "/logos/montessori-berlin-logo.png"
  },
  "ui": {
    "welcomeMessage": "Welcome to {{schoolName}} Project Elections"
  }
}
```

### Managing Multiple Deployments

```bash
# Deploy all schools
pnpm run deploy

# Deploy specific schools
./scripts/deploy.sh school1 school2

# Update Firestore rules for all projects
pnpm run deploy-rules
```

## ✅ Testing Results

All components have been tested and verified:

- ✅ Default build (waldorfwahlen configuration)
- ✅ School1 build with custom configuration
- ✅ School2 build with custom configuration
- ✅ Development server startup
